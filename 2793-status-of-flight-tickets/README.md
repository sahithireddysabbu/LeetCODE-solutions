<strong>Explanation:</strong> 
- Flight 1 has a capacity of 2 passengers. Passenger 101 and Passenger 103 were the first to book tickets, securing the available seats. Therefore, their bookings are confirmed. However, Passenger 102 was the third person to book a ticket for this flight, which means there are no more available seats. Passenger 102 is now placed on the waitlist, 
- Flight 2 has a capacity of 2 passengers, Flight 2 has exactly two passengers who booked tickets,  Passenger 104 and Passenger 105. Since the number of passengers who booked tickets matches the available seats, both bookings are confirmed.
- Flight 3 has a capacity of 1 passenger. Passenger 107 booked earlier and secured the only available seat, confirming their booking. Passenger 106, who booked after Passenger 107, is on the waitlist.
